# graph-bsf
Make your own (unweighted) graph and use BSF-method to find shortest path between vertices.
Visual_FSP:
Implemented in Tkinter. You can create a node at the position of the mouse pointer by clicking on the canvas. Edges/lines between nodes can be made by clicking on one node and then on the other. Uses a 'graph class', and saves the structure of the graph made by the user to use Breadth First Search. You can run BSF between the two nodes you put in the right bottom corner and run it by clicking on 'Find the shortest path...'. Shortest path will light up green colored.
